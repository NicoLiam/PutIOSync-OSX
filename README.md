# PutIOSync for OS X

PutIOSync is a little menubar app for your Mac that allows you to automatically download new files from [put.io](http://put.io) as they arrive in your folders there.
It can also delete successfully downloaded files from put.io and flatten folder hierarchies, if you want it to. 

It is a 64-bit ARC Mac app and it runs on OS X 10.6 and later.

## Features
- Account setup via OAuth
- Automatically watch folders on put.io and download new files as they arrive
- View current transfers happening to your put.io account
- Notification Center alerts for new/successful downloads
- Option to launch on login
